Then break the third goo(counting from the right) of the floor.... You will endup with three goo structure under windmill and two goo structure in the air(conected with the balloon... break the&nbsp; lower goo and leave the goo-balloon on the pipe.) Use two balloones to carry over the remaining three goo-s(but not to high and not to low)... they will break up against the edge of the screen and if you are lucky and fast you should carry atleast two goo-s in to the pipe (if you are ultra lucky and fast you could catch all three goo-s :) )... that is it<br><br>p.s. this means that Jairo didn't complete the chart! hi hi hi&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; :) </p></td></tr><tr class="headline"><td>Re: Max Goo chart</td><td nowrap="">JairoSoul</td><td nowrap="">02/02/2009 - 12:22</td></tr><tr class="post"><td colspan="3"><p> ???<br>I know how to obtain 24 but it's different to your way, but 25 is impossible to me.

First I've been able to kick the whistle up so it lies against the right wall, maybe if we get lucky one will fall off. Also when you get a line, have you tried kicking it to the left, it seems much easier. You can also get a gap to the left hand side so my idea is to kick the most right goo to overlap with its neighbour and puch it down the gap this would break the chain and get another goo. <br><br>I'm currently playing the new secret of monkey island game so I've put WOG on hold till i finish that.

Remember to whistle the drools to the right before detaching ivy successfully.<br>Raise the infamous one. Wedge an ivy to hold it aloft. Goo load. Use timebugs when not satisfactory. Down to last timebug, success.<br>Goo load second black goo. Get to timebug phase. After three attempts black one vanishes off stage left, ivy is frozen with marker strands, WoG has crashed, fatal error. Start again.<br>After a few dozen attempts work back to second black goo. Success (relief, more like). Up end structure, wedge with ivies. Attack 3rd black goo. Fifth attempt succeeds. Then the screen goes black. LOL (hysterical laughter). Alt-tab out. Go back in. First the cursor appears then the screen. All is well (go through goo loading the remaining black goos. Great. Err.... what about getting this lot to the pipe? Oh, I forgot!

I may not have the accuracy, but the power of throwing goo doesn't seem decreased at all. I think it's just a matter of mice being more accurate than flicking your wrist around. On a different note, it's kind of a shame that the updated chart is on pg. 17 now instead of pg. 1.

I power line is made of 11 goos and the broke line out of 9. Two goo died.

If we can figure out a method to do this without using the shaking bug then its +1 goo. I'd have to check this more. I'll also upload a video showing what I mean.<br><br>By the time I gave up on it the shaking bug has managed to destroy all connections other than 1 last strand to the bomb, its wierd.

So collecting more than 108 should be absolutely impossible, because you have to use 2 for the line. To collect all of those 108 you would have to get a line up from the bottom and then use overloading to free all others. For overloading, you need one of the sides to detach, because there are no Ivies. I don't see how it could be possible to successfully use overloading on the balls too far away from the side.<br><br>Plus I wasn't talking about a theoretically possible score, but about a realistically achievable one.

Instead of using 12 goos to make a "6-story tower" and then to use 3 more to make a line(like i did before and it's shown in all the videos)I somehow thought if I use 8 goos to make "4-story tower" that I would get those +3 goos. Insead I would get the same 100 goos only 100 times harder!! God damn!&nbsp; &gt;:(<br> I don't see how to get more if you do the normal start. That means you have to use only 4 goos to make "2-story tower" and the 3 more to make a triangle that would turn in to a line at the adge.

I tried about 40 times to get 22 goos and couldn't do it. After some times I was playing Least Time Chart and I broke that middle goo two times in three tries but I wasn't trying 22 goos. <br><br><br>And I came up with a new start in SHS. In the beginning it's the same like Kopas start. <br>-Put all fuse goos on the hand, throw a goo and light the structure, build a goo line and kick it to the hand. <br>-Now, carefully(and fast) build to the screen edge(not all the way to the edge) using fuse goos. It need only 5 goos. <br>-When the albino structure brakes against the screen edge the albinos(9 of them!!!)will fall to the new fuse structure(you will only have to catch one or two that are at the very close to the edge screen)<br><br>I calculated that this way you will definitely save 35 goos. But there is one BIG drawback here.<br><br>If you light to structure from the left(and build a line on the left) the albino structure will brake on the right side!! :(<br>That means if you want to break the albinos on the left you have to light the fuse from the right and build a line on the right and kick it from the right to the left side of the hand!! (or oposite) - Diagonally<br><br>And the fire is in the way!! I didn't try to kick it from the right to the left but I did try to build a small structure on the hand and catch all albino goos. It's possible. <br><br><br>EDIT 1: gjazz35 is a bot!<br>EDIT 2: OK, it's fixed</p><br><em>Last modified Mon, 12/14/2009 - 04:38 by Pavke</em></td></tr><tr class="headline"><td>Re: Max Goo chart</td><td nowrap="">bukaroo12</td><td nowrap="">01/17/2010 - 12:45</td></tr><tr class="post"><td colspan="3"><p>It looks like the server farm max goo balls needs updated to 29?</p></td></tr><tr class="headline"><td>Re: Max Goo chart</td><td nowrap="">Pavke</td><td nowrap="">01/17/2010 - 15:29</td></tr><tr class="post"><td colspan="3"><p>[quote author=bukaroo12 link=topic=1281.msg16154#msg16154 date=1263750355]<br>It looks like the server farm max goo balls needs updated to 29?<br><br><br>Gil, topic creator hasn't been on forum for a while. see <a href="http://2dboy.com/forum/index.php/topic,1281.240.htmlmsg13226.html#msg13226" class="bb-url"><span style="text-decoration:underline">page 17</span></a></p></td></tr><tr class="headline"><td>Re: Max Goo chart</td><td nowrap="">LTumbleweed</td><td nowrap="">01/18/2010 - 17:34</td></tr><tr class="post"><td colspan="3"><p>[quote author=Pavke link=topic=1281.msg16156#msg16156 date=1263760151]<br>[quote author=bukaroo12 link=topic=1281.msg16154#msg16154 date=1263750355]<br>It looks like the server farm max goo balls needs updated to 29?<br><br><br>Gil, topic creator hasn't been on forum for a while. see <a href="http://2dboy.com/forum/index.php/topic,1281.240.htmlmsg13226.html#msg13226" class="bb-url"><span style="text-decoration:underline">page 17</span></a><br><br><br>You also haven't updated it to show weather vane 92, but then again you didn't know about it till now lol<br><br><img src="./Max Goo chart _ World of Goo_files/weathervane92.png" alt="" class="bb-image"><br><br>I have it on video but I'll wait a few days before posting it so you can try to figure out how I did it :)</p></td></tr><tr class="headline"><td>Re: Max Goo chart</td><td nowrap="">Pavke</td><td nowrap="">01/18/2010 - 20:21</td></tr><tr class="post"><td colspan="3"><p> :o :o &nbsp;wow!

When I started the level, the whistle got stuck like this!!!!&nbsp; :o :o<br>OK I said, what should I do now? <br>I started to kick the goo cage to the left, little by little. (We know the whistle can be freed from the cage)<br>After like an hour and half I got a line, finally I kick the whistle down and opened the pipe:<br><br>[IMG width=320 height=240]<a href="http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/1062/whistle2.jpg">http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/1062/whistle2.jpg</a>[/img]<br><br> :o :o :o<br>OK, I know it's one in million to get the whistle like that in real game but it's still a chance!<br><br>Oh, and I remember back, few times I did get the whistle to land close like this, not horizontal by any means but close(didn't open the pipe didn't touch the water) but after a few kicks it got close to the pipe.<br><br>And this is totally by accident, I didn't mean this to happen. </p><br><em>Last modified Fri, 03/05/2010 - 12:22 by Pavke</em></td></tr><tr class="headline"><td>Re: Max Goo chart</td><td nowrap="">Gil</td><td nowrap="">03/03/2010 - 02:12</td></tr><tr class="post"><td colspan="3"><p>Whoa!<br>Updated the table on page1 based on page17&nbsp; :D</p></td></tr><tr class="headline"><td>Re: Max Goo chart</td><td nowrap="">AldenteVonTino</td><td nowrap="">03/03/2010 - 09:21</td></tr><tr class="post"><td colspan="3"><p> :o<br>You (yes, you reading this post!) are a bunch of clever people!
